This repo is about deep learning using DCGANs and trying to colorise grayscale pictures. I was greatly intrigued with the use of neural networks in computers, as the topic of neural networks greatly aligned with the field of cognitive neuroscience during my undergraduate time. Of course, this led me to my interest in the field computer vision within data science. For starters, I wanted to try and color gray pictures with deep learning! This was an interesting topic to myself because I am a light novel and comic reader myself. Having colored images and colored comics are always a plus point to making reading much enjoyable. Plus, colors give amazing perspective to readers too.
